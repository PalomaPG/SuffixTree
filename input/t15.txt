eightyseven cents that was all and sixty cents of itwas in pennies pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing thegrocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until ones cheeks burnedwith the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealingimplied three times della counted it one dollar and eightysevencents and the next day would be christmasthere was clearly nothing to do but flop down on the shabby littlecouch and howl so della did it which instigates the moral reflectionthat life is made up of sobs sniffles and smiles with snifflespredominatingwhile the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from the firststage to the second take a look at the home a furnished flat at per week it did not exactly beggar description but it certainly hadthat word on the lookout for the mendicancy squadin the vestibule below was a letterbox into which no letter would goand an electric button from which no mortal finger could coax a ringalso appertaining thereunto was a card bearing the name mr  jamesdillingham youngthe dillingham had been flung to the breeze during a former period ofprosperity when its possessor was being paid  per week now whenthe income was shrunk to  though they were thinking seriously ofcontracting to a modest and unassuming d but whenever mr jamesdillingham young came home and reached his flat above he was calledjim and greatly hugged by mrs james dillingham young alreadyintroduced to you as della which is all very gooddella finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the powder ragshe stood by the window and looked out dully at a gray cat walking agray fence in a gray backyard tomorrow would be christmas day and shehad only  with which to buy jim a present she had been savingevery penny she could for months with this result  twenty dollars aweek doesnt go far expenses had been greater than she had calculatedthey always are only  to buy a present for jim her jim many ahappy hour she had spent planning for something nice for him somethingfine and rare and sterlingsomething just a little bit near to beingworthy of the honor of being owned by jimthere was a pierglass between the windows of the room perhaps youhave seen a pierglass in an  flat a very thin and very agile personmay by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinalstrips obtain a fairly accurate conception of his looks  della beingslender had mastered the artsuddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the glass  hereyes were shining brilliantly but her face had lost its color withintwenty seconds rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to itsfull lengthnow there were two possessions of the james dillingham youngs in whichthey both took a mighty pride one was jims gold watch that had beenhis fathers and his grandfathers the other was dellas hair had thequeen of sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft della would havelet her hair hang out the window some day to dry just to depreciate hermajestys jewels and gifts had king solomon been the janitor with allhis treasures piled up in the basement jim would have pulled out hiswatch every time he passed just to see him pluck at his beard fromenvyso now dellas beautiful hair fell about her rippling and shining likea cascade of brown waters it reached below her knee and made itselfalmost a garment for her and then she did it up again nervously andquickly once she faltered for a minute and stood still while a tear ortwo splashed on the worn red carpeton went her old brown jacket on went her old brown hat with a whirlof skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in her eyes shefluttered out the door and down the stairs to the streetwhere she stopped the sign read mme sofronie hair goods of allkinds one flight up della ran and collected herself pantingmadame large too white chilly hardly looked the sofroniewill you buy my hair asked dellai buy hair said madame take yer hat off and lets have a sight atthe looks of itdown rippled the brown cascadetwenty dollars said madame lifting the mass with a practised handgive it to me quick said dellaoh and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings forget the hashedmetaphor she was ransacking the stores for jims presentshe found it at last it surely had been made for jim and no one elsethere was no other like it in any of the stores and she had turned allof them inside out it was a platinum fob chain simple and chaste indesign properly proclaiming its value by substance alone and not bymeretricious ornamentationas all good things should do it was evenworthy of the watch as soon as she saw it she knew that it must bejims it was like him quietness and valuethe description applied toboth twentyone dollars they took from her for it and she hurriedhome with the  cents with that chain on his watch jim might beproperly anxious about the time in any company  grand as the watchwas he sometimes looked at it on the sly on account of the old leatherstrap that he used in place of a chainwhen della reached home her intoxication gave way a little to prudenceand reason she got out her curling irons and lighted the gas and wentto work repairing the ravages made by generosity added to love whichis always a tremendous task dear friendsa mammoth taskwithin forty minutes her head was covered with tiny closelying curlsthat made her look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy she looked ather reflection in the mirror long carefully and criticallyif jim doesnt kill me she said to herself before he takes asecond look at me hell say i look like a coney island chorus girlbut what could i dooh what could i do with a dollar and eightysevencentsat  oclock the coffee was made and the fryingpan was on the back ofthe stove hot and ready to cook the chopsjim was never late della doubled the fob chain in her hand and sat onthe corner of the table near the door that he always entered then sheheard his step  on the stair away down on the first flight and sheturned white for just a moment she had a habit of saying a littlesilent prayer about the simplest everyday things and now shewhispered please god make him think i am still prettythe door opened and jim stepped in and closed it he looked thin andvery serious poor fellow he was only twentytwoand to be burdenedwith a family he needed a new overcoat and he was without glovesjim stopped inside the door as immovable as a setter at the scent ofquail his eyes were fixed upon della and there was an expression inthem that she could not read and it terrified her it was not angernor surprise nor disapproval nor horror nor any of the sentimentsthat she had been prepared for he simply stared at her fixedly withthat peculiar expression on his facedella wriggled off the table and went for himjim darling she cried dont look at me that way i had my haircut off and sold because i couldnt have lived through christmaswithout giving you a present itll grow out againyou wont mindwill you i just had to do it my hair grows awfully fast say merrychristmas jim and lets be happy you dont know what a nicewhat abeautiful nice gift ive got for youyouve cut off your hair asked jim laboriously as if he had notarrived at that patent fact yet even after the hardest mental laborcut it off and sold it said della dont you like me just as wellanyhow im me without my hair aint ijim looked about the room curiouslyyou say your hair is gone he said with an air almost of idiocyyou neednt look for it said della its sold i tell yousold andgone too its christmas eve boy be good to me for it went for youmaybe the hairs of my head were numbered she went on with suddenserious sweetness but nobody could ever count my love for you  shalli put the chops on jimout of his trance jim seemed quickly to wake he enfolded his dellafor ten seconds let us regard with discreet scrutiny someinconsequential object in the other direction eight dollars a week ora million a yearwhat is the difference a mathematician or a witwould give you the wrong answer the magi brought valuable gifts butthat was not among them this dark assertion will be illuminated lateronjim drew a package from his overcoat pocket and threw it upon the tabledont make any mistake dell he said about me i dont thinktheres anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo thatcould make me like my girl any less but if youll unwrap that packageyou may see why you had me going a while at firstwhite fingers and nimble tore at the string and paper and then anecstatic scream of joy and then alas a quick feminine change tohysterical tears and wails necessitating the immediate employment ofall the comforting powers of the lord of the flatfor there lay the combsthe set of combs side and back that dellahad worshipped long in a broadway window beautiful combs puretortoise shell with jewelled rimsjust the shade to wear in thebeautiful vanished hair they were expensive combs she knew and herheart had simply craved and yearned over them without the least hope ofpossession and now they were hers but the tresses that should haveadorned the coveted adornments were gonebut she hugged them to her bosom and at length she was able to look upwith dim eyes and a smile and say my hair grows so fast jimand then della leaped up like a little singed cat and cried oh ohjim had not yet seen his beautiful present she held it out to himeagerly upon her open palm the dull precious metal seemed to flashwith a reflection of her bright and ardent spiritisnt it a dandy jim i hunted all over town to find it youll haveto look at the time a hundred times a day now give me your watch  iwant to see how it looks on itinstead of obeying jim tumbled down on the couch and put his handsunder the back of his head and smileddell said he lets put our christmas presents away and keep em awhile theyre too nice to use just at present i sold the watch to getthe money to buy your combs and now suppose you put the chops onthe magi as you know were wise menwonderfully wise menwho broughtgifts to the babe in the manger they invented the art of givingchristmas presents being wise their gifts were no doubt wise onespossibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication andhere i have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of twofoolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each otherthe greatest treasures of their house  but in a last word to the wiseof these days let it be said that of all who give gifts these two werethe wisest of all who give and receive gifts such as they are wisesteverywhere they are
